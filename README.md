# MiniGov - Simple Tools for School Governments
MiniGov is a suite of apps combined into one easy to use platform. Created for Student Governments at schools across the United States, MiniGov makes it easy to manage projects, communicate with students, and publish meeting notes.
## Developed by Students for Students
As a two-year member of my school’s student government, I’ve witnessed the challenges we encounter in managing projects and communicating with students. MiniGov aims to address these challenges by simplifying the process and providing an easily scalable solution for managing student government tasks.
